# GHOST Blog auto install
The goal of this bash script will be to automatically install (up to the point it needs configurations) the GHOST blogger platform.
-----------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: THE SCRIPT REMOVES A FOLDER "ghost" AND A FILE NAMED "ghost_latest.zip". I AM NOT RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY POSSIBLE DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR SYSTEM. USE IT ON YOUR OWN FREE WILL
-----------------------------------------------------------
To run the script from terminal go to the folder where you downloaded the scipt
Open a terminal window (or use the command cd /FOLDER , where folder is the folder you downloaded the script)
and run the command: sudo bash ghostblog.sh

The script will download & unzip ghost and will also make any folders needed. Up from a point you need to manually configure GHOST "configure" file

This is my first public script so any optimizations and help will be apreciated.
